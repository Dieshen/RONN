## Critical Path: 7-Day Sprint Plan

### Day 1-2: ONNX Compatibility (Unblock Everything)
**Priority**: ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL** - Without this, we can't demo real models

**Tasks from TASKS.md Section 3.1 & 3.2**:
- [ ] ONNX protobuf parser (load .onnx files)
  - Graph structure conversion to internal representation
  - Node attribute parsing and validation
  - Input/output shape inference
  - Version compatibility checking
- [ ] Core ONNX operators (~20 most common):
  - **Neural Network**: Conv2D, MaxPool, AveragePool, BatchNormalization
  - **Activation**: ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, Softmax, GELU
  - **Mathematical**: Add, Sub, Mul, Div, MatMul
  - **Tensor**: Reshape, Transpose, Concat, Split, Gather, Slice
- [ ] Test with ResNet-18 or MobilenetV2 (small, well-understood models)

**Success Criteria**: Load and run inference on a real ONNX model end-to-end

---

### Day 3-4: Graph Optimization Pipeline
**Priority**: ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL** - Core differentiator for performance

**Tasks from TASKS.md Section 5.1 & 5.2**:
- [ ] Constant folding - Evaluate constant expressions at compile time
- [ ] Dead code elimination - Remove unused nodes and edges
- [ ] Node fusion - Combine compatible operations (Conv+BatchNorm+ReLU)
- [ ] Layout optimization - Memory layout selection for performance
- [ ] Provider-specific passes:
  - CPU-specific: Loop unrolling, vectorization hints
  - GPU-specific: Memory coalescing, kernel fusion

**Success Criteria**: Show measurable performance improvement (latency/memory) from optimizations

---

### Day 5: High-Level API & Integration
**Priority**: ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL** - Makes the runtime actually usable

**Tasks from TASKS.md Section 8.1**:
- [ ] High-level inference API with clean ergonomics:
  ```rust
  let model = Model::load("model.onnx")?;
  let session = model.create_session(SessionOptions::default())?;
  let outputs = session.run(inputs)?;
  ```
- [ ] Synchronous and asynchronous inference
- [ ] Batch processing support
- [ ] Error handling with context
- [ ] Builder patterns for configuration

**Success Criteria**: Simple, ergonomic API that feels natural to use

---

### Day 6: Brain-Inspired Demo (Differentiator)
**Priority**: ðŸŸ¡ **IMPORTANT** - Shows innovation and unique value

**Tasks from TASKS.md Section 6.1 (Simplified HRM)**:
- [ ] Complexity assessment engine (basic version):
  - Input size analysis (token count, tensor dimensions)
  - Simple heuristic for routing decisions
- [ ] Dual-path execution:
  - **Fast path**: BitNet provider for simple/repeated queries
  - **Slow path**: Full precision for complex/novel queries
- [ ] Demo script showing:
  - Same model in 1-bit and full precision
  - Latency comparison: BitNet ~10x faster
  - Memory comparison: BitNet 32x smaller
  - Accuracy tradeoff analysis

**Success Criteria**: Working demo of "System 1 vs System 2" routing with real performance data

---

### Day 7: Documentation & Polish
**Priority**: ðŸŸ¡ **IMPORTANT** - First impressions matter

**Tasks from TASKS.md Section 11**:
- [ ] Comprehensive README with:
  - Project overview and value proposition
  - Architecture diagram (Core â†’ Execution â†’ Graph â†’ Brain)
  - Quick start guide with code examples
  - Installation instructions
- [ ] Performance benchmarks document:
  - Latency (P50, P95, P99) vs ONNX Runtime
  - Memory usage comparison
  - Multi-GPU scaling results
  - BitNet compression/speed tradeoffs
- [ ] Example programs:
  - Basic inference (load model, run, get results)
  - Multi-GPU inference
  - Brain-inspired routing demo
  - Custom provider example
- [ ] Video demo (5-10 minutes):
  - Load real model (ResNet/MobileNet)
  - Show optimization passes
  - Demonstrate multi-GPU
  - Show BitNet routing
  - Performance comparison

**Success Criteria**: Someone can understand, install, and use RONN in <15 minutes

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Items
1. **ONNX operator complexity** - Some ops are very complex (Attention, advanced pooling)
   - **Mitigation**: Focus on 20 core operators, defer advanced ops
   - **Fallback**: Use Candle's built-in ops where available

2. **Graph optimization bugs** - Incorrect transformations break models
   - **Mitigation**: Extensive testing with known models
   - **Fallback**: Make optimizations opt-in with `--optimize` flag

3. **Performance doesn't meet targets** - Slower than ONNX Runtime
   - **Mitigation**: Start benchmarking early (Day 3-4)
   - **Fallback**: Focus on unique features (BitNet, brain-inspired) as differentiator

### Medium Risk Items
4. **Brain-inspired features too complex** - Can't finish in time
   - **Mitigation**: Simplify HRM to basic routing heuristic
   - **Fallback**: Demo architectural design + future roadmap

5. **Documentation takes too long** - Not enough time for polish
   - **Mitigation**: Write docs incrementally during development
   - **Fallback**: Prioritize README + video demo over comprehensive docs
