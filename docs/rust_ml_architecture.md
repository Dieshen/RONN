## System Overview

### High-Level Architecture

The Rust ML Runtime follows a layered architecture pattern inspired by ONNX Runtime but optimized for Rust's ownership model and safety guarantees:

```

## Component Architecture

### Core Inference Engine

The heart of the system, responsible for:
- **Session Management**: Isolating inference contexts and managing resources
- **Graph Optimization**: Provider-independent model transformations
- **Execution Planning**: Optimal scheduling of operations across hardware
- **Memory Management**: Efficient tensor allocation and lifetime management

#### Key Components:

**Session Manager**
```rust
pub struct SessionManager {
    sessions: DashMap<SessionId, InferenceSession>,
    resource_pool: Arc<ResourcePool>,
    metrics_collector: MetricsCollector,
}

impl SessionManager {
    pub async fn create_session(&self, model: ModelGraph) -> Result<SessionId>;
    pub async fn run(&self, session_id: SessionId, inputs: &[Tensor]) -> Result<Vec<Tensor>>;
    pub async fn destroy_session(&self, session_id: SessionId) -> Result<()>;
}
```

**Graph Optimizer**
```rust
pub struct GraphOptimizer {
    optimization_passes: Vec<Box<dyn OptimizationPass>>,
    profiler: OptimizationProfiler,
}

pub trait OptimizationPass: Send + Sync {
    fn apply(&self, graph: &mut ModelGraph) -> Result<bool>;
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
    fn cost_estimate(&self, graph: &ModelGraph) -> OptimizationCost;
}
```

### Hierarchical Reasoning Module (HRM)

Brain-inspired hierarchical processing system:

```rust
pub struct HierarchicalReasoningModule {
    high_level_planner: HighLevelPlanner,
    low_level_executor: LowLevelExecutor,
    task_router: TaskRouter,
    attention_mechanism: AttentionMechanism,
}

impl HierarchicalReasoningModule {
    pub fn route_task(&self, input: &Tensor) -> ReasoningPath {
        let complexity = self.assess_complexity(input);
        match complexity {
            ComplexityLevel::High => ReasoningPath::HighLevel,
            ComplexityLevel::Medium => ReasoningPath::Hybrid,
            ComplexityLevel::Low => ReasoningPath::LowLevel,
        }
    }
}
```

### Multi-Tier Memory System

Inspired by biological memory hierarchies:

```rust
pub struct MultiTierMemorySystem {
    working_memory: WorkingMemory,      // Short-term, high-capacity
    episodic_memory: EpisodicMemory,    // Experience storage
    semantic_memory: SemanticMemory,    // Long-term knowledge
    consolidation_engine: SleepConsolidationEngine,
}

pub struct WorkingMemory {
    buffer: CircularBuffer<MemoryItem>,
    capacity: usize,
    eviction_policy: LRUPolicy,
}

pub struct EpisodicMemory {
    episodes: VectorStore<Episode>,
    index: HnswIndex,
    compression: CompressionScheme,
}
```

### Execution Provider Framework

Hardware abstraction layer supporting diverse accelerators:

```rust
pub trait ExecutionProvider: Send + Sync {
    fn get_capability(&self) -> ProviderCapability;
    fn compile_subgraph(&self, subgraph: SubGraph) -> Result<CompiledKernel>;
    fn execute(&self, kernel: &CompiledKernel, inputs: &[Tensor]) -> Result<Vec<Tensor>>;
    fn get_allocator(&self) -> Arc<dyn TensorAllocator>;
}

pub struct CPUExecutionProvider {
    thread_pool: ThreadPool,
    simd_support: SIMDCapabilities,
    numa_topology: NumaTopology,
}

pub struct GPUExecutionProvider {
    candle_device: candle_core::Device,
    memory_pool: GpuMemoryPool,
    stream_manager: StreamManager,
}
```

## Brain-Inspired Features

### 1. Hierarchical Reasoning

The HRM implements a two-level reasoning system:
- **High-Level Planner**: Handles complex, multi-step reasoning tasks
- **Low-Level Executor**: Optimized for simple, pattern-matching operations
- **Dynamic Routing**: Automatically determines the appropriate processing level

### 2. Multi-Tier Memory

Three distinct memory systems working in concert:
- **Working Memory**: Immediate context and active computations
- **Episodic Memory**: Stores experiences for pattern recognition and learning
- **Semantic Memory**: Long-term knowledge graph for conceptual understanding

### 3. Sleep Consolidation

Asynchronous background process that:
- Transfers important memories from episodic to semantic storage
- Optimizes memory organization for faster retrieval
- Implements forgetting mechanisms to prevent memory overflow
- Updates model weights based on accumulated experiences

### 4. Continual Learning

Multi-timescale learning system:
```rust
pub struct ContinualLearningEngine {
    fast_weights: TensorMap,     // lr=0.01, rapid adaptation
    slow_weights: TensorMap,     // lr=0.001, stable knowledge  
    elastic_constraints: EWCConstraints,
    experience_replay: ExperienceBuffer,
}
```
